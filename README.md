# DF_CivNoblesMod
This Dwarf Fortress mod will add usuable nobels to the Humans Civ and add more nobels to Dwarfs.




This will make the Humans an actual playable civ instead of just adding in a token to allow you to play as them.




I know there are a lot of jokes about nobels, but I kind of like them so I want to add/modify them in dwarf's civ a bit.
