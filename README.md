# DF_CivNoblesMod
This Dwarf Fortress mod will add usuable nobels to the Humans Civ and add more nobels to Dwarfs.  Made using v0.44.09.




This will make the Humans an actual playable civ instead of just adding in a token to allow you to play as them.  They will have the same nobels as dwarves with slightly different names.  The reason for this is if you play as the humans without adding any nobles you won't have any to appoint.  The reason this normally isn't a problem is because the nobles are generated dynamically in the game.




I know there are a lot of jokes about nobels, but I kind of like them so I want to add/modify them in dwarf's civ a bit.




You can copy/paste just the changes to dwarves or just the humans in the game.  You can also just replace the entity_default.txt file from here with the file in your Dwarf Fortress save.
